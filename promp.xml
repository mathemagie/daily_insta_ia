            A serene beach at sunset, with soft waves lapping against the shore. The Polaroid image captures the golden hues of the sun melting into the horizon, casting a warm glow over the scene. A single seashell rests in the foreground, its delicate spiral pattern glinting softly. In the background, a silhouette of a couple walking hand in hand adds a touch of romance.
